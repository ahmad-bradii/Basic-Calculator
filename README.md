## How It Works

The calculator functionality is powered by the JavaScript **`eval()`** function.Â 

### What is `eval()`?

`eval()` is a built-in JavaScript function that evaluates a string as JavaScript code and executes it. For instance:

    eval("3 + 5"); // Returns 8
    eval("12 / 4"); // Returns 3
Note: While eval() can be convenient, it's crucial to understand its security implications. Avoid using eval() with untrusted user input, as it can be exploited for malicious code execution.
