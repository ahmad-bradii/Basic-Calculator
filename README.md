## How It Works

The calculator utilizes the JavaScript **`eval()`** function.

### What is `eval()`?

`eval()` is a built-in JavaScript function that executes a string as code. For example:

    eval("3 + 5"); // Returns 8
    eval("12 / 4"); // Returns 3

Note: While convenient, be aware of its security risks. Avoid using eval() with untrusted input to mitigate the risk of malicious code execution.
